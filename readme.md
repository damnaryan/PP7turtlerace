## This is a learning project.
I am making this project to learn python.So, instead of learing the syntax first, I am building this project to learn while I am building this. I have made notes within the code as comments, of every new concept I get to know.

### About this project:
THIS IS A GOOD INTERMIDATE LEVEL PROJECT. At least for me, it is. Instead of a text based program, this is full fletched graphic game. With animations and stuff! Here, the users define the number of turtles, that would be racing. And at the end print the colour of the winning turtle.

### [ IN PROGRESS ]

## Learnings:

###### racer = turtle.Turtle() # setting up the turtle as a variable.
###### racer.forward(100)      # moves the turtle forward by 100 pixels.
###### racer.right(90)         # turns the turtle right by 90 degrees.
###### racer.left(90)          # turns the turtle left by 90 degrees.
###### racer.backward(100)     # moves the turtle backward by 100 pixels.
###### racer.shape('round')    # change the icon shape (round, turtle, arrow are some valid shapes).
###### racer.color('cyan')     # change the colour of the turtle.
###### racer.speed(5)          # change the speed of the turtle.
###### racer.penup()/.pendown()# toggle the pen for the turtle.
